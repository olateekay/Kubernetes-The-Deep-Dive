**This documentation describes the steps required to setup a multi node Kubernetes cluster for development purposes. This setup provides a production-like cluster that can be setup on your local machine.**

With a multi-node cluster, we mimick a production -like environment.
A multi node cluster also helps to solve problems or bugs that are related to application design and architecture. For instance, Ops can reproduce an issue in a multi node cluster environment, Testers can deploy multiple versions of an application for executing test cases and verifying changes. These benefits enable teams to resolve issues faster which make the more agile.
